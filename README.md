# Titanic Miniproject

Competition page - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Currently this is a store of testing some model theories on a simple binary classification task.  

Mostly used as a testing ground to build some simple model types from the ground up.  Some of them worked, some of them did not but all of them gave me some useful insights into things I hadn't had the chance to test.

Ideas tested - 
* Genetic Programming from Scratch
* Decision Trees from Scratch
* Gradient Boosting
* GANs
* Autoencoders
* Direct Non-Differentiable Metric Optimization in Tensorflow

All codes developed in iPython notebooks with various packages.
